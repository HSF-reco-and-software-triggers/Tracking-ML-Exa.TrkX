# Tools, Techniques and Best Practices

- Explain the rationale and aim
- Give examples of some tools and applications
  - Radius-graph/knn from FAISS
  - Edge matching
  - Truth graph builder (Pandas building, would be nice to get this on CuPy)
  - Triplet selection (possibly use the PyEmbedding version - benchmark)
  - Triplet/line graph converter
  - Checkpointing
  - Mixed precision
  - Remove duplicate edges
  - Cell feature calculation
  - Training best practices (data balancing, hard negative mining, load balancing)
